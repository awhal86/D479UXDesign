        <p class="info">
            There are a variety of transportation options to not only get to the island, but once you are here as well. To get to the island, you currently have three options: a small jet plane from 
            from another local island, a small propeller plane from a nearby island, or a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Bay for one night per week. Soon, we plan to expand the airport to accommodate 
            larger jets to land on the island. Once you are here, you have many options for exploring the island. Many tourist stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing, which is relatively easy to explore 
            on foot. However, if you wanted to venture futher or just have other options; there is plenty to choose from. Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m to 11 p.m. daily. Private busses serve the 
            rest of the island. Taxis are available in the city, and cars can be rented from a local agency near the aitport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law).
